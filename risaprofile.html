<h4 style= "color:#990000"><b><u>ABOUT ME</b></u> </h4>
<p style= "color:black">Hello, I am Risana Muahmmed. I am a pursuing undergrad degree in Bachelor of Commerce combined with ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) from Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery. I have a deep passion for both the fields of business and technology and I am a committed player to excel in my academic journey and lay a strong foundation in both the fields.

It all began with my schooling at Sharjah Indian School, UAE, when my interest in business study and accounting became keen. This has only grown stronger with time and has helped me attain a combination of commerce and professional accounting certification. I do believe that the combination of these two fields will enable me to meaningfully add value to the business world and provide a unique set of skills balancing financial acumen with strategic thinking.
Other than academics, I am also very much interested in web design and development. Recognizing the growing importance of digital presence and technology in todayâ€™s business environment, I chose to include web designing and development as one of my key subjects during my college years. I am looking forward to mastering the technical abilities to develop and maintain fully functioning, user-friendly websites, which will particularly involve how such expertise can be harnessed in the optimization of business processes and marketing activities with respect to productivity.

I am always an ambitious, hardworking, and proactive student; hence I always want to gain knowledge, skills, and expertise. Having a strong interest in accounting as well as business, I have aimed to be a well-rounded professional going about making a difference in the ever-evolving business landscape. By being devoted to studying and interested in technology and design, I will be able to make a meaningful contribution to any future professional opportunities I am exposed to.
